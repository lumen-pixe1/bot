# TwitchDropsBot

This project is inspired by [TwitchDropsMiner](https://github.com/DevilXD/TwitchDropsMiner/). I used it on Linux but faced several compatibility issues, so I decided to create my own solution.

The main goal of this project is to help users claim their Twitch drops when they are unable to watch streams. For example, in Europe, some drops are hard to get because they require watching American streams late at night (e.g., Rust).

> [!WARNING]  
> This bot is still a work in progress. Sometimes it may fail to collect drops due to frequent updates to Twitch's backend.  

> **Disclaimer**
> This project is provided for educational purposes and personal use only. Use it at your own risk. By using this project, you acknowledge that you have been warned. The author cannot be held responsible for any suspension, limitation, or banning of Twitch accounts. Issues related to account limitations, suspensions, or bans will not be considered. Any use for automated farming or bot farms is strictly discouraged.

## Getting Started

### Compiled Version

Whenever I consider a new version ready for release, I publish it on the [Releases](https://github.com/Alorf/TwitchDropsBot/releases) page.

#### Usage

1. Download the bot.
2. Launch the bot.
3. Log in.
4. Close the bot.
5. Update the config file.
6. Relaunch the bot.
7. You're done!

#### Updates

1. Download the bot.
2. Copy and paste your config file.
3. You're done!

## Postman

Twitch frequently changes the hashes for GQL operations used by the bot.  
Iâ€™ve created a Postman collection that contains all the required GQL requests.  
If the bot stops working, you can replace the hashes using this collection.  
Once updated, simply export your collection and replace the old one.

> [!NOTE]  
> The updated collection must have the same name as the original one.
